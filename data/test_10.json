However, there are counterexamples. For example, $c=30$ and $b=20.$ Both numbers are divisors of $60,$ but $20$ is not a factor of $30$ because there is no integer $n$ such that $30=20 \\cdot n.$ This statement is false.\n\nD) If $a$ were to be $20,$ then the given inequality would be $20<b<c<60$ where $b$ and $c$ are factors of $60.$ Listing out the factors of $60,$ we see $1,$ $2,$ $3,$ $4,$ $5,$ $6,$ $10,$ $12,$ $15,$ $20,$ $30,$ $60.$ However, there is only one factor of $60$ that is between $20$ and $60,$ so it is impossible to choose a $b$ and $c$ that satisfy the conditions. Thus, this statement is true.\n\nE) If $b$ is negative, then by the given inequality, so is $a$ because $a<b.$ We also know that $a$ is a divisor of $b.$ Thus, there exists an integer $n$ such that $b=a \\cdot n.$ Dividing both sides by $a$ yields $n=\\frac{b}{a}.$ Because both $a$ and $b$ are negative, $n$ must be positive. Recall that $\\frac{x}{y}=\\frac{-x}{-y}.$ Thus, the fraction $\\frac{b}{a}$ where $a<b$ and both are negative is the same as the fraction $\\frac{-b}{-a}$ where $-a>-b.$ However, because both the numerator and denominator are positive, and the denominator is greater than the numerator, it is impossible for this fraction to be an integer.

Therefore, if we want $\\frac{n^2}{2010}$ to be a repeating decimal, then $n^2$ cannot be divisible by 3 and 67 at the same time. If this were the case, then we could convert our fraction to $\\frac{k}{10}$, where $201k = n^2$, and $\\frac{k}{10}$ is clearly a terminating decimal. Conversely, no simplified terminating decimal has a factor of 3 or 67 in the denominator. It follows that if $n$ is not divisible by $3\\cdot 67$, then $n$ is a repeating decimal. Therefore, we need to compute the number of values of $n$ that yield squares which are not divisible by 3 and 67. However, $n^2$ is divisible by 3 and 67 if and only if $n$ must be divisible by 3 and 67. Therefore, $n$ cannot be divisible by $3 \\cdot 67=201$.
